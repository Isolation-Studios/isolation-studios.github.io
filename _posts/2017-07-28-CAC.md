A point and click puzzle is in the works now.

Material CSS has also been trashed for Bootstrap again :/...

### So what's happening??

We have started work on a point and click game exploring the human psyche. Details are still being worked out, but a heavy focus is being put on art and storytelling. Our story features genderless child who yearns for a life outside of his bland, grey life. One day, they find and enter a portal to a colorful world on the other side. Child is happy, but not for long; the world turns out to be just as gray as their own. Oh woe! What can man-girl do now? Their alternate dimensional self, a being of vibrant color tells child to paint the world. Tasked with a tasteless, blank canvas, follow us as our MC solves puzzles, unravels their broken past, and ultimately finds out more about themselves and the true meaning of happiness.

...

Or at least that's as best as I can articulate our game.

### Misc

  - Screenshots and concept art in the works
  - Site's still in the works. More to come!
  - We might get a Disqus for comments?
  - Bigger game in the works after CAC

See y'all soon!!
