Hai, domo!

Progress is inching along :smile: ...and Disqus happened wooooo!

We have a Twitter now where weekly posts will tried to be made as part of Screenshot Saturday.
I find it's a nice way to keep projects in check and also share your stuff with others. Big posts will probably still
be made on this blog so don't forget about us here!

### Progress Report
  * Art: Maps and rough concept; waiting for artists to flesh it out
  * Code: started building maps and minipuzzles
  * Music: Still composing; we may have vocals :open_mouth:
  * Story: MC will overcome 4 puzzles to realize her past traumas
