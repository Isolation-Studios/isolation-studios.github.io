It's been a while. Most of the team has been busy with other stuff,
so the project has been on hiatus. That being said, some art assets are
still in the works but don't expect anything too soon.

### Progress Report
  * Art: Making backgrounds
  * Code: on hold, will implement features when progress makes it there
  * Music: still no word...
  * Story: writing story

Sorry folks, short update. We haven't been able to work much on it.

Thank you for your patience.
